## Environment Variables

### `MONGO_AUTH_CREDENTIALS`

Credentials to connect to your MongoDB instance. You can find this in the MongoDB Atlas dashboard. You must be manually provided access to that dashboard. Once you have access to the dashboard, click on `Connect` > `Connect your application` next to the database that you want to connect to. Under `Select your driver and version`, select `Python` as `Driver` and set the `Version` as `3.6 or later`. Copy the text that you are shown in the section `Add your connection string into your application code`. Ask an admin for the password and replace `myFirstDatabase` with `quiz`. Use the final updated value for this environment variable.
