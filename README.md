# Quiz Backend

Backend for the Avanti Quiz Engine created using FastAPI and MongoDB!

## Installation

## Running locally

Simply run:

Once the docker image has completed building, you can use `http://127.0.0.1:3000` as the base URL of the endpoints and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/docs` to see the auto-generated docs! :dancer:
